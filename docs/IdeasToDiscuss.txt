----------------------------------------------
Important:
Should we include how many copies of item we have in the system or should we create a duplicate entry for
each one?
E.g.
2 copy's of a Java book in the system as:
1,java,thisguy
2,java,thisguy
or
1,java,thisguy,2 //with 2 representing the number of copy's

Will we also assume about the Author class will it represent producer and director for CDs and DVDs

Also with LibraryItem should we remove Author and just place the LibraryItem straight into the Author Class for the
authoredBooks?


Lots of duplicates in each item class, do you guys know of a better way for it?


----------------------------------------------
Saving, Loading and Files:
When opening the application should we load the data from the files and keep them in memory.
Then on object creation we add it to the file and save it to the linkedlist in memory?

Or should we only load upon searching or sorting?

----------------------------------------------
With the files:
Should we keep each type of item saved in a different file like
Book.csv
AudioBook.csv
CD.csv

Or we could have them all stored in a LibraryCatalogue.csv but that would include adding in extra fields.

----------------------------------------------
Testing
Unit testing, will have to look into that again

----------------------------------------------
Any other ideas on functionality to add:
If we have time we could add a reserve item function
